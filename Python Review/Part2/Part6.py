    # 1. import only the log function from the math module so that log() can be called

    # 2. import everything from math module

    # 3. generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) using the random module

    # 4. open a new file titled output.txt and set to write

    # 5. write several lines to output.txt

    # 6. close the file

    # 7. open the output.txt file

    # 8. read all the lines of output.txt at once into a list variable

    # 9. iterate over each line in the list, strip any whitespace from the line, and print the line to the screen

    # 10. use the range function to generate a series of numbers from 1 to 100

    # 11. use the range function to generate a series of numbers from 1 to 100 in increments of 3
