My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
a)	
1.	Bifidobacterium longum is a non-pathogenic, mutualistic bacterium that is believed to prevent growth of pathogenic organisms via production of lactic acid. Although it is not especially prevalent in the human adult gut, it is considered to be one of the earliest colonizers of the infant GI tract.
2.	Eubacterium rectale is a normal component of the human gut microbiota, thought to produce butyrate, which is an important energy source for cells in the colonic epithelium. Its prevalence in the gut appears to be similar to that of individual species from the Bacteroides genus.
3.	Roseburia intestinalis breaks down sugars in order to produce butyrate, thus possessing a protective effect against colon disease by nourishing colonocytes (similar to E. rectale). Depressed levels of R. intestinalis are associated with various bowel conditions, while elevated levels may provide protection against atherosclerosis (at least in mice) and may promote weight loss.
4.	Baceroides ovatus is an anaerobic, non-spore-forming, nonmotile, and Gram-negative rod bacterium. It is the predominant commensal instinal microbe which causes a systemic antibody response in inflammatory bowel disease.

5.	Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a Gram-negative anaerobe. It is one of the most common components of the human gut flora. It specializes in the digestion of polysaccharides and provides food for other components of the microbiome. As an opportunistic pathogen, it also has extreme diseases causing potential as well as antibiotic resistance.

6.	Lactobacillus acidophilus is a Gram-positive bacterium which grows rapidly at low pH values and around 37 degrees Celsius. Some strains are considered to have probiotic characteristics and are able to make lactic acid by breaking down carbohydrates. This bacterium also has medical uses and is sometimes prescribed to treat diarrhea.

7.	Peptoniphilus timonensis  is a Gram-positive and anaerobic bacterium. Its presence is sometimes reported in diabetic skin and soft tissue infections, bone and join infections, surgical site infections, chorioamnionitis, and bloodstream infections.

8.	Prevotella copri is a gram-negative bacteria which is anaerobic and does not form spores. The cells are rod shaped and grow best at 37 degrees Celsius.  Some variants of the species may likely be involved in the onset of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Some studies also show that the presence of Prevotella copri causes a reduction of other beneficial microbes.

9.	Ruminococcus bromii is a dominant member of the human gut microbiota that plays a key role in releasing energy from dietary starches that escape digestion by host enzymes via its exceptional activity against particulate “resistant” starches. It is a keystone species in the breakdown of resistant starch in the human large intestine. It is a specialized amylolytic bacterium known for its ability to degrade cellulose.

10.	Vibrio cholera is a bacterium commonly found in saltwater. Some strains of this bacterium can cause cholera, an infection of the small intestine which can induce diarrhea which can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, vomiting, and muscle cramps. It is a facultative anaerobe and can undergo respiratory and fermentative metabolism.
