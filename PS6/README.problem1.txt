f) As you increase the order from 1 to 4 for the Conrad texts (heart of darkness), there is a drastic improvement of the text. With an order of 1, these texts are unable to be read nevertheless identified. However, as you increase the order, the words become more distinguishable. Once you reach an order of 4, the product is a very readable text. 

The Milton texts improve in a similar manner as the difference between the text produced with an order of 1 and an order of 4 is also substantial. The text with an order of 1 is hardly readable while the text with an order of 4 is readable for the most part with majority distinguishable words. 

When comparing the two different types of text at order 1, it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the two. At order 2, it is still extremely difficult as there is still a lack of distinguishable words and cohesive sentences. At order 3, short words become evident so it may be possible to identify which text each came from but it would still not be immediately explicit. However, for order 4, the texts generated are relatively clear enough to be able to distinguish which text came from which artificial text, for someone who is familiar with the writing styles of the two authors.

g) 

1) The word-based model is likely to produce a more realistic output since the Markov Model would implement the next word using the highest probability of words which follow at each point. This would result in the most cohesive sentences since there is the highest chance of implementing the ideal proceeding word at each point. This also reduces the possibility of spelling errors of words. When doing the letter-based Markov model, there is the possibility for misspelt words which can also lead to additional future errors. If you are only using words rather than letters for your models, there will only be misplaced words rather than misplaced letters within words which would result in a more readable format. 
2) The new computational issues which would arise would be dealing with words of different lengths. For the letter-based Markov model, there was able to be a consistent amount of letters used in each model. However, since not all words are the same length, it may be difficult to identify where each word starts and begins in order to account the number of words being used in each order of the model. 


h) The periods would be treated the same as a letter so there would be a probability of a period following each letter where it was in the original text. Therefore, the text generated may have periods in the middle of words or in between words where they are not desired. The period would also take the place of a letter so the text would be more difficult to read due to missing letters in words replaced by periods and having general punctuation in the wrong locations.
