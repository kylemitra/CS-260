My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
a)Based on the diagram provided, I would expect the system to be in state1 about 55% of the time and the system to be in state2 about 45% of the time. There are two possible starting scenarios, either the system will start in state 1 or start in state 2. If you mentally simulate 100 rolls from each of these starting points, you get the following:

Starting in 1 (for 100 iterations):
90% of the time in 1 and 10% of the time in 2

Starting in 2 (for 100 iterations):
20% of the time in 1 and 80% of the time in 2

If you average these two possibilities, you get that it is expected for the system to be in state 1 about 55% of the time and state 2 about 25% of the time.

b) See file: artificial_genome.txt

c) Results generated by generate_sequence

Percent of time in state1 66.5 %
Percent of time in state2 33.5 %

d) Compared to part a, the results from part c indicate that the system spends on average more time in state1 than it does in state2. I had predicted that it would be about a 55%/45% split but it seems that the true percentage is actual higher. This is not too surprising however, since when the system is in state 1, there is a very high chance (90%) that it will remain in state1 for the next iteration. Additionally, when the system is is state2, there is a higher chance of a transition from state 2 to 1 (20%). All the numbers of this system indicate that the preferential state is state one and therefore, most of the time, the system should remain in state 1.

e) The results generated from the ntide_sequence method in generate_sequence.py are:

{'A': {'1': 203, '2': 56}, 'C': {'1': 135, '2': 105}, 'G': {'1': 128, '2': 95}, 'T': {'1': 198, '2': 79}}

This yields:
State 1: A:203, C:135, G:128, T:198 Total:664
State 2: A: 56, C:105, G:95, T:79 Total: 336

Calculated percentages:
State 1: A:0.3057 C:0.2033 G:0.1928 T:0.2981
State 2: A:0.1667 C:0.3125 G:0.2827 T:0.2351

These calculated nucleotide distributions are very close to the expected distributions defined by the HMM. Based on the way my method was constructed, I believe that there should mot be any regions in my artificially derived sequence which were generated in one state but have observed nucleotide frequencies that look like the other state.
